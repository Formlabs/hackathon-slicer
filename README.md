## About
This project is a simple slicer for DLP-based 3D printers.

![Example screenshot](https://github.com/Formlabs/hackathon-slicer/blob/master/example.png)

It runs in your browser, using WebGL and the stencil buffer to voxelize `.stl` files.  
The resulting slices are delivered as a zip file full of `.png` images.

A hosted version and further documentation can be found
